- 📊 Track progress: Not Started / In Progress / Completed
- 🧪 Record mock test scores by exam and section
- 📈 Visualize your preparation with progress charts
- 🗃️ Data saved in JSON and CSV formats
- 💡 Clean, modular Python code

## 🧰 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- matplotlib (for charts)

Install dependencies:
                    
                    pip install matplotlib

3. ⬜ Not Started

## 💡 Tips
- Use different sections for subjects like Quant, Logical Reasoning, Verbal, etc.
- Add mock tests per exam and analyze section-wise trends later.
- Extend it to include notes, study plans, or reminders.

## 🛠 Future Improvements (Optional)
- Add a Flask or Tkinter GUI
- Auto-calculate average mock test scores
- Add reminders or daily goals
